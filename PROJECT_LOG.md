- Completed: Made the sidebar fill the full browser height by adding 'height: 100%;' to the html element and 'h-full' to the body element in `src/index.css`.
- Completed: Explicitly set the sidebar to fill full browser height by changing `h-full` to `h-screen` on the `aside` element in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`.
- Completed: Made the sidebar always fixed by removing 'md:relative' from the `aside` element's `className` in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`.
